# README

This is an NFL Fantasy Pick-Em Team App.

## Getting started

To get the Rails server running locally:

-The first step in this getting this app working is needing an API key from MySportsFeeds. 

    -https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/

    -These keys are not free and do require a minimum $1 a month commitment to get access to the data. 

    -You will need to create a API key for the 2020 NFL reguslar season, seasson games. 

    -Once the key is aquired, you will need to add the key and password to a .env vile in the root directory of the app in order to have a local 
    enviorment file.

        -The Gem you will use to acheive this is called Dotenv (links to Gem are below)

    -Once the key and password are created, add these to the .env file with the following format:

        -API_KEY=0000000-1111-4444-5555-121212:MYSPORTSFEEDS

        -This will pass the key and password into the URL when called.
